/**
 * The signed-in tree. Everything under this layout can assume a Person, and it is
 * where the shell goes — `/masuk` stays outside it, because a sign-in screen with a
 * sidebar offers navigation to someone who cannot navigate yet.
 *
 * **This is the cheap outer gate, and it is not the last word.** There are three
 * checks and only the third cannot be bypassed:
 *
 *   1. `proxy.ts` — optimistic, cookie present or not. Never authoritative.
 *   2. This layout — authoritative for **pages**, and only for pages.
 *   3. `@sugt/db`'s choke point — the one that covers writes.
 *
 * The distinction is load-bearing rather than pedantic: **a Next.js layout does not
 * run before a Server Action.** A Server Action runs before the layout re-renders, so
 * a layout-only check protects reads and leaves every write open. The query layer is
 * what closes that, and it is a separate spec.
 *
 * It calls `getPerson()` and redirects rather than `requirePerson()` and throwing,
 * because a revoked Person arriving mid-session should land on the sign-in screen and
 * not on an error page. Everything **inside** this tree uses `requirePerson()`, where
 * a null can only come from a bug. Both share one memoised read, so the page below
 * costs no second round trip.
 *
 * `role` and `personName` were a placeholder literal until this landed — the shell was
 * built against issue #14 while knowing-who-is-asking was still issue #24. They are now
 * the session's.
