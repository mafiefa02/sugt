 * Indonesian sentence for **every** value of `?error` and never echoes it, so the
 * indistinguishability is true by construction — this constant only makes the two
 * routes agree on the wire as well.
 *
 * It is a code and not prose on purpose. A thrown message arrives underscored, and
 * Better Auth's built-in error page validates the code against
 * `/^['A-Za-z0-9_-]+$/` and renders `UNKNOWN` on anything else. The Indonesian

 *   `message` — so the browser lands at `/masuk?error=NOT_ON_INVITE_LIST`.
 * - The revocation hook's throw escapes to the callback route, whose `catch` redirects
 *   **only when `e.body.code` is set** and otherwise rethrows. Without `code` a revoked
 *   Person would get a 500 instead of the sign-in screen.
 *
