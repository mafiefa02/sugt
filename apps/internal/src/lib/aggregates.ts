/**
 * **The producer half of the aggregates contract.** `@sugt/db` returns the data; this turns it into
 * the payload that goes over the wire — storage paths become full public URLs, and each payload is
 * stamped with its `version`. The reason both live here and not in `@sugt/db`: a URL needs
 * `SUPABASE_URL` and a version is a fact about the two apps' wire contract, neither of which is the
 * database's concern (`docs/adr/0008-…`).
 *
 * **The secret is read at call time, never at module scope.** A `const` at the top of a route file
 * is evaluated during `next build`, where the variable need not be set, and would fail the build.
 * `publicUrlFor` already reads `SUPABASE_URL` this way; `authorizeServiceCaller` reads
 * `AGGREGATES_SECRET` the same way.

/**
 * **The version each payload carries, and the one rule for changing it.** Bump a payload's version
 * only when a field is **removed or retyped** — a change that makes an older `@sugt/public` read a
 * value that is no longer there or no longer the shape it expects. **Adding a field does not bump
 * it**: an older reader ignores what it does not know. The two apps deploy independently, so this is
 * the mechanism that lets `@sugt/public` refuse a payload it cannot read rather than render half of
 * one.
 *
 * These are **not** in `@sugt/domain`: both apps import it, so a shared constant would make the
 * check vacuous. The point is that the two sides can hold different numbers after one deploys first.
