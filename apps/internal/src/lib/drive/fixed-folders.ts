/**
 * **The fixed part of ADR-0040's tree**, ensured on every connect:
 *
 * ```
 * My Drive/
 * ├── SUGT 2026 _staging — jangan dibagikan/      ← a SIBLING of the root, never inside it
 * └── SUGT 2026 Internal App Object Storage/      ← the root
 *     ├── README
 *     └── Bukti Transaksi/
 *         └── Pelaksanaan Offline/
 * ```
 *
 * `_staging` sits outside the root because Drive permissions are inherited: if someone ever moves the
 * root under a link-shared company folder, files nobody has verified yet must not come with it.
 *
 * **First connect** creates all five. **A reconnect** reuses every stored id that `getFile` still
 * finds untrashed, and recreates a missing subfolder or README. **A trashed or missing root or
 * `_staging` is reported, never recreated**: a fresh root would orphan every Perjadin folder under
 * the old one, and the Administrator can restore it from the trash and reconnect.
 *
 * **It never throws.** If Drive fails partway — a 5xx, the network — it stops and answers what it had
 * made by then with `folders-unfinished`, so those ids are still recorded and the next reconnect
 * reuses them rather than making a second root.
