/**
 * **Rename a Perjadin's Drive folders after its name changed** (#376, #407, ADR-0040), so the company
 * Drive shows `perjadinFolderName` (ADR-0044) — its receipts folder and, once it has one, its Dokumen
 * folder (ADR-0042). Called when either of the trip's dates is corrected, and when a Session write
 * changes the trip's Schools: a Session added at a School not yet on it, one moved to another
 * School, or a School's last live Session cancelled. File names carry neither, so nothing else moves.
 * A Sub-Cluster rename calls nothing: the next reconcile on each trip, or Periksa koneksi, re-asserts
 * the name.
 *
 * **Best effort, after the commit.** The write has already been made; nothing here can fail it or
 * roll it back. A trip with no Drive folder yet, or a connection that is not `connected`, makes no
 * call to Google at all. The fixed tree need not be resolved — renaming one folder by its id needs
 * none of it. A rename that fails is logged and left: the next reconcile that touches this Perjadin —
 * a Catat transaksi or Unggah bukti on it, or a sweep that reaches one of its unsynced lines — or the
 * next press of Periksa koneksi re-asserts the name, because names are app-owned. Until one does, the
 * folder keeps the old name.
