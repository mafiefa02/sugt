/**
 * Who still owes what against this Session — now the **PIC's Session Record**, and nothing else.
 *
 * **The online Class-Record "who owes what" machinery is gone** (T3, #153). It counted Records
 * filed against Records expected off the two `session_teacher` professors, but online teachers are
 * free-text names now (ADR-0022) who cannot sign in and file, `session_teacher` is dropped, and
 * Class Records are deferred for both modes — so there is no expected set to report and no
 * teachers list to render here. What survives is the Session Record the Staff PIC owes.
 *
 * A server component that renders a read-only list, plus one interactive leaf: beside the owed
 * Session Record, if the signed-in person is the one who owes it, the form to file it. `personId`
 * is that person's id — the form appears for their own Record and nobody else's.
 *
 * **The form is offered to the person the tool chases, which is narrower than who may file.**
 * `owed` names the PIC, empty until the Session is delivered (ADR-0009). The write is broader:
 * `fileSessionRecord` admits any Staff member, not only the PIC, because `docs/data-model.md`
 * says any Staff who was there may file one while the PIC's is the one chased. A non-PIC Staff
 * member's Session Record is therefore permitted by the write and has no screen here yet —
 * a stated boundary, not an oversight.
