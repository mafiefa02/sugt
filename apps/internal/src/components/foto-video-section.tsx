 * **The Foto & Video section on `/sesi/[id]`** (#425), so a Pimpinan — who cannot open `/pendamping`
 * — sees a Session's photos and videos too. The list, with **Buka** for everyone; for whoever writes
 * the Session's trip (its Group, an Editor or an Administrator — ADR-0048), **Hapus** and the upload
 * popup. A cancelled Session keeps its list but offers no upload. An upload or a Hapus
 * revalidates this page in its own Server Action, so the list here follows without a refresh.
