/**
 * The sidebar's destinations, in order — with one exception: **Pendamping moves to the top when the
 * viewer cannot see the Dashboard** (#353). The rule is keyed on `canViewDashboard`, not on a Role or
 * Grant name, and it means "if `/` would redirect you to `/pendamping`, Pendamping is your first
 * link" — today only a grant-less Staff. It is not a "home page" rule: sign-in lands every Staff on
 * `/pendamping` whatever their Grants, so for a Staff who sees the Dashboard the top link and the
 * landing page differ, deliberately.
 *
 * `staffOnly` is the sidebar's whole share of the access rule: **delivery data is open,
 * money is not** (ADR-0004). The Perjadin list and detail stay open, because a professor
 * gets a money-free variant of both and needs it to file a Perjadin Evaluation. Cerita is
 * Staff-only for a different reason: publishing is (ADR-0008), and a link to a screen
 * that will refuse you is worse than no link. Arranging delivery — Rencanakan Perjadin and
 * Jadwalkan Sesi Daring — is Staff-only too (the surface list, #9/#70), but those two create-actions
 * are no longer sidebar entries: each is a Staff-only button on its list page (`/perjadin`,
 * `/sesi-daring`) instead (#294), so the sidebar shows only the always-open list links.
 *
 * **Perjadin Report is not here, and its absence is the answer to a question issue #30
 * owned.** The Report is the acquittal state on one `perjadin` row — there is no
 * `perjadin_report` table — so it lives at `/perjadin/[id]/laporan` and is reached from the
 * trip it accounts for. A top-level entry would have needed an index of trips to point at,
 * and nothing asked for one.
 *
 * Omitting a link is not access control. The gate is a Staff-only choke point in the
 * data layer, which is issue #25 rather than this shell.
 *
 * `editorOnly` is a second, narrower dimension beside `staffOnly` (ADR-0028): a link shown only to an
 * Editor (an Administrator implies it). `/pretest` carries it — its page `forbidden()`s a
 * non-holder, so linking a screen that would refuse them is the same "worse than no link" rule the
 * Staff-only entries follow. The shell resolves the Grant once and passes the boolean down.
 *
 * `dashboardView` is a third such dimension (#322): the `/` link is shown only when the viewer may
 * read the Dashboard — a `Pimpinan` by Role, a `Staff` holding `Editor` or `Dashboard Viewer`. Its
 * page redirects a grant-less Staff to `/pendamping`, so — same rule again — the link is hidden for
 * exactly the callers it would bounce. The shell computes `canViewDashboard` once (the one predicate
 * the page guard shares) and passes the boolean down.
 *
 * `administratorOnly` is a fourth (#372): **Pengaturan** is shown only to an Administrator, because
 * its page `forbidden()`s everyone else — the same "worse than no link" rule once more. **Log**, the
 * Activity Log (#395), carries it for the same reason.
 *
 * **Pengaturan carries a badge while Drive needs an Administrator** (#375) — not connected, broken,
 * or its folders unresolved: the states in which nobody can upload a receipt. Only Administrators
 * see the link, so only they see the badge, and they are the ones who can act on it.
