 * rather than a list — a Session comes into existence when it is arranged and never
 * before (ADR-0006), so there are no rows waiting to be filled in. The design handoff
 * lays all ten out with *"Belum dijadwalkan"* against the unplanned ones; that is the
 * schedule ADR-0006 rejects, and it is not built here.
 *
 * A cancelled Session stays in the list with the reason it was called off. It counts
 * for nothing, and that is the point of showing it: a School that was planned for and
 * missed looks different from one nobody has reached yet.
