 * Open to anyone signed in, so the signature takes a `Person` and applies no further
 * check: delivery data carries no money, and ADR-0004 opens it to both roles.
 *
 * **Only the Sessions that exist are listed.** A School is due ten and the number is
 * fixed from the start, but a Session comes into existence when it is arranged and
 * never before ([ADR-0006](../../../../docs/adr/0006-sessions-are-created-when-arranged.md)),
 * so there is no such thing as a row for a Session nobody has arranged. The ten is the
 * denominator and nothing else. The design handoff lays all ten out with *"Belum
 * dijadwalkan"* against the unplanned ones; that is the schedule ADR-0006 rejects, and
 * it is not built.

 * `pj.destination` as its subject, because it has no Session and no School to report.
