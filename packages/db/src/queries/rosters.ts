 * what earns a shared helper — so they moved down here.

 * that a surface renders, and no surface renders these — they are shared SQL beneath two
 * modules, which is exactly the case that convention makes room for.

 * holds exactly one, so no id appears in both. Each filters on its role explicitly rather than
 * assuming every active Person is Staff — the pre-#179 shape did the latter and would now wrongly
 * fold Pimpinan into `staff`. The teaching team a planning form once picked from People is
 * trip-scoped / session-scoped free-text names now (ADR-0020, ADR-0022), typed on the form rather
 * than chosen from a roster.
 *
 * **Revoked People are not here.** `person.active = false` is the whole revocation
 * mechanism ([ADR-0013](../../../../docs/adr/0013-people-are-added-in-the-tool-and-their-role-is-write-once.md)),
 * and naming a revoked Person commits them to a trip that has not happened. Historical references
 * to them stay intact; a picker is about what happens next.
