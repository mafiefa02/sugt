/**
 * **The PIC's Session Record form**, filed against a Session that has been delivered.
 *
 * **The Class Record write path was retired in T3** ([#153](https://github.com/mafiefa02/sugt/issues/153)):
 * a Class Record was filed by a `Teaching Team` Person, but that role is gone — online teachers are
 * free-text names now (ADR-0022) and offline ones always were (ADR-0020), and neither can sign in and
 * file. The `class_record` table stands as a dead surface (its Teaching-Team FK unsatisfiable); Class
 * Records are deferred for both modes, the `CONTEXT.md` open question.
 *
 * The Session Record is a write and owns its transaction, by convention 5 beside this package: the
 * status read and the insert sit in one transaction, and the constraint catch sits outside
 * it, as `moveSessionDate` does. **The delivered gate is best-effort, not a lock** — the read
 * takes no `for update`, so a Session cancelled between the read and the insert is not
 * prevented, and deliberately: `docs/data-model.md` says nothing in the database stops a
 * Record against an arranged or cancelled Session, so the gate is the application being
 * helpful rather than an invariant to serialise around. It is not a Staff-only *read*, so it
 * exposes no payload function here; the reads that render these Records live on `./session-detail.ts`.
 *
 * **The elaboration rule is the one `docs/data-model.md` calls _enforced twice by design_.**
 * A Rating at or below `CONCERN_AT_OR_BELOW` cannot be filed without prose, and that is
 * checked here beside the write **and** by `class_record_low_rating_needs_prose` /
 * `session_record_low_rating_needs_prose` behind it. The application half is what makes the
 * refusal a value the form can put on a field; the CHECK is what makes it true of every
 * write path, this one included. See convention 4's note on `./index.ts`.
