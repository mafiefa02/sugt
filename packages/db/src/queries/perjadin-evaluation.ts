/**
 * **The Perjadin Evaluation** — how the trip went, as against how the teaching went. Four Aspects
 * about the journey and none about a School.
 *
 * **Filed without signing in, through a token link (ADR-0024).** This used to be a
 * signed-in write gated on membership of the Group that travelled. That gate silently excluded
 * exactly the voices the evaluation wants — the name-based Narasumber and the record-only Pimpinan,
 * neither of whom has a login — so #167 retargeted it onto the Participant Feedback token pattern
 * (ADR-0012). Two writes and no read, exactly as that ADR draws it: `issuePerjadinFeedbackToken`
 * is a normal signed-in write that mints the per-Perjadin token whose URL becomes a QR code, and
 * `filePerjadinEvaluation` takes a `PerjadinToken` — a caller the app produces by resolving that
 * token, never one signed in — and inserts one `perjadin_evaluation` row and nothing else. The
 * resolution that turns the token into the caller is an app-side step
 * (`apps/internal/src/lib/perjadin-feedback-token.ts`), because the token has to be checked before
 * there is a caller to check it as (see `./caller.ts`).
 *
 * **Not Staff-only, and no dedup.** A Perjadin Evaluation carries no money, so by ADR-0004 it
 * follows the open-delivery rule — anyone signed in may issue the token. The old "only the Group
 * may file" and "one per filer" are both gone with the sign-in gate: the filer self-declares a Role
 * and a Name, untrusted by design, and a duplicate is allowed (the accepted cost of the token
 * pattern, #167).
 *
 * The elaboration rule is **kept unchanged from #163/ADR-0023**, retargeted per-Aspect: a Rating at
 * or below `CONCERN_AT_OR_BELOW` on Aspect X needs X's OWN Komentar, checked here beside the write
 * and by `perjadin_evaluation_low_rating_needs_prose` behind it. A comment on a different Aspect no
 * longer excuses a low one. **`lodging` is a nullable Rating**: a skipped hotel needs no comment,
 * exactly as Postgres `least()` drops a NULL out of the minimum.

 * Pimpinan. Unlike the Session token there is **no cancelled bar**: a Perjadin is a real trip once
 * it exists and is never cancelled, so the token always has a live trip behind it.
 *
 * **It never replaces a link** (ADR-0049), exactly as `issueFeedbackToken` does not: it reads the
 * trip's existing link and inserts only when there is none, and of several (only
 * `db:reattach-links` adds a second) it returns the original — the earliest `issued_at`, then
 * `token`. The Perjadin row is locked for the lookup and the insert, so two presses at the same
 * moment queue on it and the second reads the link the first inserted.
